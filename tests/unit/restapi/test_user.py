"""Test suite for user and authentication operations.

This module contains a set of tests that validate the CRUD operations and additional
functionalities for the user entity and auth endpoint. The tests ensure that users
can register, login, logout, change their password, access account information, and
delete their accounts. The tests also check that the "remember me" cookie functionality
works as expected.

        changing the password to not work. This behavior is limited to the test client
