Tensorflow Adversarial Patch
============================

.. include:: /_glossary_note.rst

.. warning::

   Some of the demos assume that you have access to an on-prem deployment of Dioptra that provides a copy of the Fruits360 and ImageNet datasets and a CUDA-compatible GPU.
   These demos cannot be run on a typical personal computer.

This demo provides three different versions of the adversarial patch attack on separate image classification datasets and model architectures.
The three available Jupyter notebooks explore the following poisoning attacks:

-  ``demo-mnist-patches.ipynb``: Applies adversarial patch attack on the :term:`MNIST` dataset. Includes preprocessing and adversarial training defenses.
-  ``demo-fruits360-patches.ipynb``: Applies adversarial patch attack on Fruits360 dataset. Includes adversarial training defenses.
-  ``demo-imagenet-patches.ipynb``: Applies attack on the ImageNet dataset. Uses a pretrained model with the ``init`` entrypoint, rather than train a new model with the ``train`` entrypoint.

Users are welcome to run the demos in any order.
The :term:`MNIST` demo takes the shortest time to complete and contains an additional set of defense examples.
For more information regarding attack and defense parameters, please see the attack and defense sections of the `MLflow Entrypoint Overview <#MLflow-Entrypoint-Overview>`__ section.

Users can also explore the following preprocessing defenses from their associated defense entry points:

-  Spatial Smoothing: Smooths out an image by passing a median filter through neighboring pixel values in images.
-  Gaussian Augmentation: Adds gaussian noise to an image.
-  JPEG Compression: Applies an image compression algorithm over the image.

Please note that the patch attack generally bypasses most preprocessing defenses, see ``demo-mnist-patches.ipynb`` for details.

Getting started
---------------

MNIST patches demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything you need to run the ``demo-mnist-patches.ipynb`` demo on your local computer is packaged into a set of Docker images that you can obtain by opening a terminal, navigating to the root directory of the repository, and running ``make pull-latest``.
Once you have downloaded the images, navigate to this example’s directory using the terminal and run the demo startup sequence:

.. code:: bash

   make demo

The startup sequence will take more time to finish the first time you use this demo, as you will need to download the :term:`MNIST` dataset, initialize the Testbed :term:`API` database, and synchronize the task plugins to the S3 storage.
Once the startup process completes, open up your web browser and enter ``http://localhost:38888`` in the address bar to access the Jupyter Lab interface (if nothing shows up, wait 10 to 15 more seconds and try again).
Double click the ``work`` folder and open the ``demo-mnist-patches.ipynb`` file.
From here, follow the provided instructions to run the demo provided in the Jupyter notebook.
**Don’t forget to update the ``DATASET_DIR`` variable to be: ``DATASET_DIR = "/nfs/data"``.**

If you want to watch the output logs for the Tensorflow worker containers as you step through the demo, run ``docker-compose logs -f tfcpu-01 tfcpu-02`` in your terminal.

When you are done running the demo, close the browser tab containing this Jupyter notebook and shut down the services by running ``make teardown`` on the command-line.
If you were watching the output logs, you will need to press Ctrl-C to stop following the logs before you can run ``make teardown``.

On-prem deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run any of the demo notebooks using an on-prem deployment, all you need to do is download and start the **jupyter** service defined in this example’s ``docker-compose.yml`` file.
Open a terminal and navigate to this example’s directory and run the **jupyter** startup sequence,

.. code:: bash

   make jupyter

Once the startup process completes, open up your web browser and enter http://localhost:38888 in the address bar to access the Jupyter Lab interface (if nothing shows up, wait 10 to 15 more seconds and try again).
Double click the ``work`` folder, open the notebook of your choosing, and follow the provided instructions in the Jupyter notebook.

When you are done running the demo, close the browser tab containing this Jupyter notebook and shut down the services by running ``make teardown`` on the command-line.

MLflow Entrypoint Overview
--------------------------

Here are the available MLflow entry points used by the demos and their associated parameters.

Common Training and Testing Entry Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``init_model``: Loads a pretrained model available from the TensorFlow library into the MLflow model storage. Evaluates the model on an available test set

   -  Additional Notes:

      -  Named models generated by this entry point follow the pattern: ``{EXPERIMENT_NAME}_{model_tag}_{model_architecture}``
      -  If ``model_tag`` is left blank, the models are instead named: ``{EXPERIMENT_NAME}_{model_architecture}``

-  ``infer``: Loads and evaluates an model from MLflow storage on a test set created from another MLflow run.

   -  Parameters:

   -  Additional Notes:

      -  Most data preprocessing steps and attack deployment steps will generate a data artifact (ex. ``adv_testing.tar``) which will contain the specified dataset of interest (ex ``adversarial_patched_data``).
      -  Users must specify the artifact tarfile and dataset name in order to properly transfer the inputs between job runs.

      -  ``seed``: Specifies an integer seed value for controlling randomized tensorflow behavior.

   -  Additional Notes:

      -  Named models generated by this entry point follow the pattern: ``{EXPERIMENT_NAME}_{model_tag}_{model_architecture}``
      -  If ``model_tag`` is left blank, the models are instead named: ``{EXPERIMENT_NAME}_{model_architecture}``
      -  When ``load_dataset_from_mlruns`` is set to true, the provided data artifact is used over the default dataset location.
      -  As a result the ``training_dataset_run_id``, ``dataset_tar_name``, and ``dataset_name`` parameters must be provided when ``load_dataset_from_mlruns`` is true. If false, they are not used in the job.
