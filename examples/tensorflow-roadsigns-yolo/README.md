# Tensorflow Road Signs YOLO Demo

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT!**
>
> This README is out of date and will be updated in the near future.
>
> There is a new setup tool that all users should use to configure and run Dioptra, please see the new sections [Building the containers](https://pages.nist.gov/dioptra/getting-started/building-the-containers.html) and [Running Dioptra](https://pages.nist.gov/dioptra/getting-started/running-dioptra.html) that have been added to the documentation.

>⚠️ **Warning:** This demo assumes that you have access to an on-prem deployment of Dioptra that provides a copy of the Road Signs dataset and a CUDA-compatible GPU.
> This demo cannot be run on a typical personal computer.

The demo provided in the Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb` contains an example of how to set up and train a model based on the YOLO v1 architecture and use it to perform object detection on the Road Signs dataset.
