# Tensorflow Road Signs YOLO Demo

>⚠️ **Warning:** This demo assumes that you have access to an on-prem deployment of Dioptra that provides a copy of the Road Signs dataset and a CUDA-compatible GPU.
> This demo cannot be run on a typical personal computer.

The demo provided in the Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb` contains an example of how to set up and train a model based on the YOLO v1 architecture and use it to perform object detection on the Road Signs dataset.
