> There is a new setup tool that all users should use to configure and run Dioptra, please see the new sections [Building the containers](https://pages.nist.gov/dioptra/getting-started/building-the-containers.html) and [Running Dioptra](https://pages.nist.gov/dioptra/getting-started/running-dioptra.html) that have been added to the documentation.

The demo provided in the Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb` uses Dioptra to run experiments that investigate the effects of the robust DPatch attack when launched on a neural network model trained on the stop sign dataset.
